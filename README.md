Periodic Min/Max Helpers for Home Assistant

The helpers record the minimum or maximum of a sensor until manually reset via the reset action. The value is maintained through HA restarts.

## Example use cases

- Record the maximum temperature today, resetting at midnight via an automation.
- Record the peak solar energy produced ever, reset when you upgrade your solar installation.
